Everyone loves [Rubygems][Rubygems]. And you probably have heard of the `--no-rdoc` & `--no-ri` flags, right? The flags that fasten up your gem installation since you do not have to generate the RDoc and ri documentation? Ah, I see you also have heard about it. Well, I figured those flags are now deprecated. Time to replace them with new stuff. It is called `--no-document` now.

Best thing to add it to your `~/.gemrc` file (and create one if you don't have one yet). Create a `~/.gemrc` file like this:

```
gem: --no-document
```

Now you don't have to worry about this anymore.
